# Phonepe_Pulse_Data_Visualization
Phonepe Pulse Data Visualisation:
Data visualization refers to the graphical representation of data using charts, graphs, and other visual elements to facilitate understanding and analysis

These visualizations are designed to present information in a visually appealing and easily digestible format, enabling users to quickly grasp trends, patterns, and insights from their transaction history.

Problem Statement:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics.The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

Approach:
1. Data extraction:
Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
2. Data transformation:
Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data.
This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
3. Database insertion:
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
4. Dashboard creation:
Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.
5. Data retrieval:
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe.
Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. Deployment:
Ensuring the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
Testing the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
